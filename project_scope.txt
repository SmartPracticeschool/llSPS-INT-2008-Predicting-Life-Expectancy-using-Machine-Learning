PROJECT SCOPE:

	Project Summary:
		This project is about predicting the Life Expectancy using Regressive Machine Learning models.
		The name of the project makes it self-explanatory about its functionalities.
		Here we predict the possible life expectancy by statistically analysing the factors influencing Life Expectancy, on the 'Life Expectancy (WHO)' dataset available at Kaggle.

	Project Requirements:
		-> Life Expectancy dataset
		-> IBM Cloud Services
		-> Watson Studio
		-> Building ML Models with Python
		-> Creating End-points for Node-RED Integration

	Functional Requirements:
		-> Life Expectancy dataset
		-> IBM Cloud Services
		-> Jupyter Notebook

	Technical Requirements:
		-> Creating Notebook in IBM Watson
		-> Importing data to Watson
		-> Building ML Models with Python
		-> Creating End-points for Node-RED Integration

	Software Requirements:
		-> IBM Cloud Services
		-> Watson Studio

	Project Deliverables:
		The end result of this project will be an ML model that will predict the Life expectancy of a human based on:
			-> Country
			-> Year
			-> Developed/Developing Country
			-> Adult Mortality
			-> Infant Deaths
			-> Alcohol
			-> Expenditure
			-> Hepatitis B
			-> Measles
		(Data provided by Kaggle)

	Project Team:
		This is a solo project under SmartBridge

	Project Schedule:
		May 19, to June 18, 2020.
